## Phonetic

Puzzle variations in which sounds are the basic unit instead of letters.

## Examples

### Phonetic [beheadment](base/beheadment)

<Step>quest</Step>
<Step><del>q</del>uest</Step>
<Finally>west</Finally>

### Phonetic [charade](base/charade)

<Step>lox + myth</Step>
<Finally>locksmith</Finally>

### Phonetic [curtailment](base/curtailment)

<Step>cute</Step>
<Step>cu<del>t</del>e</Step>
<Finally>queue</Finally>
  
In a phonetic curtailment, TWO can be longer than ONE; what counts is the number of sounds, not the number of letters. In fact, the greater the change in spelling, the more interesting the base.

## When to Label

A flat is phonetic if any part is phonetic, even if some parts are not. For example, this phonetic charade:

<Step><label>ONE</label> weigh + <label>TWO</label> ding</Step>
<Finally><label>ALL</label> wading</Finally>

No flat is labeled phonetic if it can also work as a letter-based puzzle.

<Step>mite</Step>
<Step><del>m</del><ins>r</ins>ite</Step>
<Finally>rite</Finally>

'Mite' to 'rite' is both a first-[letter change](base/letter-change) and a first-sound change, but it is called a first-letter change.

<Step>mite</Step>
<Step><del>m</del><ins>r</ins>ite</Step>
<Finally>right</Finally>

'Mite' to 'right' has to be a first-sound change.

## Sound Identification

The underlined letters, as pronounced in the following words, stand for single sounds: l<u>ou</u>d, <u>ch</u>in, <u>wh</u>ale, <u>j</u>oke, si<u>ng</u>, c<u>oi</u>n, <u>sh</u>ip, <u>th</u>in, <u>th</u>is, vi<u>si</u>on. These sounds are indivisible. On the other hand, these represent two sounds: f<u>ew</u> and c<u>u</u>rable. The y and oo sounds are separate.

Modern pronunciation varies widely; you&rsquo;re likely to encounter phonetic flats that don&rsquo;t work in your speech. They are still legal and valid as long as MW substantiates their pronunciation. These pronunciation variations are common enough to be acceptable without comment in flats:

w = hw. For most Americans, <span class="w">where</span> and <span class="w">wear</span> are homonyms.

For many Americans, T and D have the same sound between two vowels if the second vowel is unstressed; <span class= "w">latter</span> and <span class="w">ladder</span> are homonyms.

&auml; = &#335;. For most Americans, <span class= "w">bother</span> rhymes with <span class="w">father</span>. For a minority, <span class="w">cot</span> is a homonym of <span class="w">caught</span>.

Before a vowel sound, ar = er = &#257;r. Many Americans pronounce <span class="w">Mary</span> and <span class= "w">merry</span> the same, and a large minority pronounce <span class="w">marry</span> the same as the other two. 11C is not consistent on this point; NI3 explains it. Phonetic flats based on this pronunciation are not tagged &ldquo;NI3 pronunciation.&rdquo;

r = schwa or nothing. For many r-droppers, <span class= "w">card</span> and <span class="w">cod</span> are homonyms, as are <span class="w">manners</span> and <span class= "w">mannas</span>.

schwa = short i, most often unstressed. For many, <span class= "w">language</span> and <span class="w">languid</span> are a last-sound change.
