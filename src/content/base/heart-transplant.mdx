## Heart transplant

In a heart transplant, a letter or series of letters is taken from inside one word and transplanted to another. Example: <Example><Step><label>ONE</label> c~le~ar, <label>TWO</label> wild</Step> <Finally><label>THREE</label> car, <label>FOUR</label> wil<ins>le</ins>d</Finally></Example> (transplanting the LE). (This would appear in the solution list as “c(le)ar, wil-d.”) Another example: ger(ry)mander, car-away.

The heart transplant was invented by Xemu and introduced in June 1997.
