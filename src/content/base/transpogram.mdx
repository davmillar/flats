## Transpogram

A word or phrase becomes another when divided into two parts, which are interchanged. Examples: <Example>rock-hard, hard rock <label>(referring to the kind of music)</label></Example>; or <Example>fast break, breakfast</Example>. Answers must be dictionary entries (or well known) but the parts need not be: for example, <Example>alloy, loyal</Example>.

A transpogram is most interesting if the parts have substantially different meanings. Houseguest and guest house, for example, are a dull base. Since interesting bases are hard to come by, the transpogram has always been an uncommon type.

In the **[phonetic](modifier/phonetic) transpogram**, the two parts that switch remain true to sound but not to spelling. Examples: welfare, farewell; or Dear John (a kind of letter), John Deere (a brand name); or zero, rosy.
