## Homonym

Two or more unrelated words or phrases are pronounced the same but spelled differently. Example: <Example>hair, hare</Example>. Unlike most flats, homonyms need not have bases that are dictionary entries. Example: <Example>we pause, wee paws</Example>.

A **mynomoh** is a reversed homonym; the phonemes of one solution provide the second solution when read in reverse order. Example: <Example><Step>lutetium</Step> <Finally>mushy tool</Finally></Example>.
