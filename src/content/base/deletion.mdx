## Deletion

A word or phrase becomes another when an interior letter is removed.

<span class="before">simile</span> <span class="before">s<del>i</del>mile</span> <span class="after">smile</span>

> DELETION (*7, 4-2)
> 
> We found a TWO for shelter from the sun-<br/>
> So unrelenting was the summer heat-<br/>
> And looked out at the sparkling Gulf of ONE,<br/>
> Where long ago the Turks had met defeat.

<span class="before"><label>ONE</label> Lepanto</span> <span class="before">Le<del>p</del>anto</span> <span class="after"><label>TWO</label> lean-to</span>

A deletion may include more than two words.

<p class="example-block">
<span class="before">startling</span> <span class="before">star<del>t</del>ling</span><br/>
<span class="before">starling</span> <span class="before">star<del>l</del>ing</span><br/>
<span class="before">staring</span> <span class="before">st<del>a</del>ring</span><br/>
<span class="before">string</span> <span class="before">st<del>r</del>ing</span><br/>
<span class="before">sting</span> <span class="before">s<del>t</del>ing</span>
<span class="after">sing</span>
</p>

(Do you want to go on to THREE = sin and TWO = in? In NPL terms, those are not deletions but one curtailment and one beheadment. You could still use all eight words in one puzzle, but you&rsquo;d have to warn the solver that two-unspecified-steps were a <a href="base/curtailment">curtailment</a> and <a href="base/beheadment">beheadment</a>, not deletions.)

### Baltimore deletion

Each letter in turn is removed to form a new word.

<p class="example-block">
<span class="before">peat</span> <span class="before"><del>p</del>eat</span> <span class="after">eat</span><br/>
<span class="before">peat</span> <span class="before">p<del>e</del>at</span> <span class="after">pat</span><br/>
<span class="before">peat</span> <span class="before">pe<del>a</del>t</span> <span class="after">pet</span><br/>
<span class="before">peat</span> <span class="before">pea<del>t</del></span> <span class="after">pea</span>
</p>

### Bigram deletion

A word or phrase becomes another when two consecutive interior letters are removed.

<span class="before">catenary</span> <span class="before">ca<del>te</del>nary</span> <span class="after">canary</span>

### Repeated-letter deletion

A word or phrase becomes another when one letter is removed wherever it occurs.

<p class="example-block">
<span class="before">bassist</span> <span class="before">ba<del>ss</del>i<del>s</del>t</span> <span class="after">bait</span><br/>
<span class="before">prospered</span> <span class="before"><del>p</del>ros<del>p</del>ered</span> <span class="after">rose-red</span>
</p>

### Reversed deletion

After you&rsquo;ve deleted a letter from the first word, you reverse it to get the second. 

<span class="before">espalier</span> <span class="before">espal<del>i</del>er</span> <span class="before"><span class="reverse">espaler</span></span> <span class="after">relapse</span>

### Phonetic deletion

A word or phrase becomes another when an interior sound is removed.

<span class="before">revelry</span> <span class="before">revel<del>ry</del></span> <span class="after">reveille</span>

For discussion of what constitutes a single sound, see <a href="modifier/phonetic">phonetic flats</a>.

### More Examples

All sorts of combinations of these elements are possible.

<span class="before">derri&egrave;res</span> <span class="before">d<del>er</del>i<del>&egrave;r</del>es</span> <span class="after">dries</span>

#### Repeated-trigram deletion

<span class="before">card-carrying</span> <span class="before"><del>car</del>d-<del>car</del>rying</span> <span class="after">drying</span>
