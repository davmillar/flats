## Deletion

A word or phrase becomes another when an interior letter is removed.

<Step>simile</Step> <Step>s<del>i</del>mile</Step> <Finally>smile</Finally>

A deletion may include more than two words.

<p class="example-block">
<Step>startling</Step> <Step>star<del>t</del>ling</Step><br/>
<Step>starling</Step> <Step>star<del>l</del>ing</Step><br/>
<Step>staring</Step> <Step>st<del>a</del>ring</Step><br/>
<Step>string</Step> <Step>st<del>r</del>ing</Step><br/>
<Step>sting</Step> <Step>s<del>t</del>ing</Step>
<Finally>sing</Finally>
</p>

(Do you want to go on to THREE = sin and TWO = in? In NPL terms, those are not deletions but one curtailment and one beheadment. You could still use all eight words in one puzzle, but you&rsquo;d have to warn the solver that two-unspecified-steps were a <a href="base/curtailment">curtailment</a> and <a href="base/beheadment">beheadment</a>, not deletions.)

### Baltimore deletion

Each letter in turn is removed to form a new word.

<p class="example-block">
<Step>peat</Step> <Step><del>p</del>eat</Step> <Finally>eat</Finally><br/>
<Step>peat</Step> <Step>p<del>e</del>at</Step> <Finally>pat</Finally><br/>
<Step>peat</Step> <Step>pe<del>a</del>t</Step> <Finally>pet</Finally><br/>
<Step>peat</Step> <Step>pea<del>t</del></Step> <Finally>pea</Finally>
</p>

### Bigram deletion

A word or phrase becomes another when two consecutive interior letters are removed.

<Step>catenary</Step> <Step>ca<del>te</del>nary</Step> <Finally>canary</Finally>

### Repeated-letter deletion

A word or phrase becomes another when one letter is removed wherever it occurs.

<p class="example-block">
<Step>bassist</Step> <Step>ba<del>ss</del>i<del>s</del>t</Step> <Finally>bait</Finally><br/>
<Step>prospered</Step> <Step><del>p</del>ros<del>p</del>ered</Step> <Finally>rose-red</Finally>
</p>

### Reversed deletion

After you&rsquo;ve deleted a letter from the first word, you reverse it to get the second. 

<Step>espalier</Step> <Step>espal<del>i</del>er</Step> <Step><span class="reverse">espaler</span></Step> <Finally>relapse</Finally>

### Phonetic deletion

A word or phrase becomes another when an interior sound is removed.

<Step>revelry</Step> <Step>revel<del>ry</del></Step> <Finally>reveille</Finally>

For discussion of what constitutes a single sound, see <a href="modifier/phonetic">phonetic flats</a>.

All sorts of combinations of these elements are possible.

#### Repeated-bigram deletion

<Step>derri&egrave;res</Step> <Step>d<del>er</del>i<del>&egrave;r</del>es</Step> <Finally>dries</Finally>

#### Repeated-trigram deletion

<Step>card-carrying</Step> <Step><del>car</del>d-<del>car</del>rying</Step> <Finally>drying</Finally>

#### Repeated-tetragram deletion
