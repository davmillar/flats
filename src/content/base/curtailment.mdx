## Curtailment

A word or phrase becomes another when its last letter is removed.

```  <p> Example: ONE = <span class="w">stingy</span>, TWO =
  <span class="w">sting</span>.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <table class="flat" border="0" cellpadding="2">
      <tr>
        <td>CURTAILMENT (8)</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>I&rsquo;m a young LONGER chemist, but so far I&rsquo;ve
        failed<br>
        To discover a drug that&rsquo;s as good as CURTAILED.<br>
        My motives are pure: to make the world healthy<br>
        And in the process become really wealthy!</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td align="right">=Mr. Tex</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The solution: LONGER = <span class="w">aspiring</span>, FINAL
  = <span class="w">aspirin</span>.</p>

  <p>A curtailment may consist of more than two words, though these
  are rare. An obscure but dazzling example: ONE = <span class=
  "w">chorizont</span> (one who ascribes the Iliad and the Odyssey
  to different authors-look it up in NI2 if you don&rsquo;t believe
  it!), TWO = <span class="w">C-horizon</span> (a particular layer
  of soil), THREE = <span class="w">chorizo</span> (a kind of spicy
  sausage).</p>

  <p>In a <span class="term">bigram curtailment</span>, a word or
  phrase becomes another when its last two letters are removed. For
  example, ONE = <span class="w">satiety</span>, TWO = <span class=
  "w">Satie</span>.</p>

  <p>In a <span class="term">phonetic curtailment</span>, a word or
  phrase becomes another when its last sound is removed. For
  example: ONE = <span class="w">qt</span> (as in &ldquo;on the
  qt&rdquo;), TWO = <span class="w">cute</span>, THREE =
  <span class="w">queue</span>. For discussion of what constitutes
  a single sound, see <a href="mods.html#phonetic">phonetic
  flats</a>.</p>

  <p>In a <span class="term">reversed curtailment</span>, after
  curtailing the first word, you reverse it to get the second.
  Example: ONE = <span class="w">stinky</span>, TWO = <span class=
  "w">knits</span>.</p>```
