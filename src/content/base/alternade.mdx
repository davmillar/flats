## Alternade

A word or phrase is divided into two or more others by taking alternate letters in order. For example, <Example><Step><label>TOTAL</label> s**c**h**o**o**l**e**d**</Step> <Finally><label>ONE</label> shoe, <label>TWO</label> **cold**</Finally></Example>; or <Example><Step><label>TOTAL</label> l**a**<ins>c</ins>e**r**<ins>a</ins>t**e**<ins>d</ins></Step> <Finally><label>ONE</label> let, <label>TWO</label> **are**, <label>THREE</label> <ins>cad</ins></Finally></Example>. The shorter parts need not be all the same length. (In the example, the asterisks indicate capitalized words.)

<blockquote>
    ALTERNADE (*7)
    
    In *ONE&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s most famous mausoleum;<br/>
    Hawaii&rsquo;s where they garland you with TWOs.<br/>
    The nomads (I would rather see than be &lsquo;em)<br/>
    Of ALL remove Saharan sand from shoes.
    
    =Corn Cob
</blockquote>

The solution: <Example><Step><label>ALL</label> A**l**g**e**r**i**a</Step> <Finally><label>*ONE</label> Agra, <label>TWO</label> **lei**</Finally></Example>.

When the shorter parts are single words-as in the above example-enumeration is given only for the longest part; it&rsquo;s easy to deduce the lengths of the shorter parts from this.

The alternade was introduced by L&rsquo;Allegro in June 1917.

Because there seem to be few good bases for alternades, this type has never been very common. However, it forms the basis for the more popular **rebus alternade**, or <a href="base/rebade" class="todo">rebade</a>.
