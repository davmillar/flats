## Homoantonym

Two words or phrases sound like two other words or phrases that are antonyms. Examples: <Example>knights, daze</Example>; or <Example>plane, fan see</Example>. Unlike most flats, homoantonyms need not have bases that are dictionary entries.

Enumerations are given for both parts of the solution (though not for the antonyms they sound like).

Both parts of a homoantonym must be spelled differently from the antonyms they sound like. The antonyms are tagged if necessary, even though they donâ€™t themselves appear in the puzzle.

The homoantonym was introduced by Quefanon in September 1938.
