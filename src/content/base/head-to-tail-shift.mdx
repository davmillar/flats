## Head-to-Tail Shift

A word or phrase becomes another when its first letter is moved to its end. For example: <Example><Step><label>ONE</label> ~e~manate</Step> <Finally><label>TWO</label> manate<ins>e</ins></Finally></Example>; or <Example><Step><label>ONE</label> <del>b</del>rand</Step> <Finally><label>TWO</label> R and <ins>B</ins></Finally></Example>.

<blockquote>
HEAD-TO-TAIL SHIFT (5 3, *3 *5)<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;(HOO = *3 *5 = not MW)

The HOO is best seen in this scene we&rsquo;ve all
seen:<br/>
Poor Scarlett refuses to let her man go.<br/>
&ldquo;Another day, Tara, I&rsquo;ll win my Rhett
back!&rdquo;<br/>
Against disillusionment Scarlett OHO.<br/>
Genteel men like Butler and ladies like her<br/>
Inhabit plantations and wear fancy clothes.<br/>
So as for Miss Scarlett -- her Butler is gone,<br/>
But Tara survives, and the cotton still grows.

The solution: <Example><Step><label>OHO</label> <del>h</del>olds out</Step> <Finally><label>HOO</label> Old Sout<ins>h</ins></Finally></Example>.

In a **head-to-tail sound shift**, a word or phrase becomes another when its first sound is moved to its end. For example: <Example><Step><label>ONE</label> <del>ci</del>ao</Step> <Finally><label>TWO</label> ou<ins>ch</ins></Finally></Example>.

In a **reversed head-to-tail shift**, a word or phrase becomes another when its first letter is moved to its end, and then the whole is reversed. For example: <Example><Step><label>ONE</label> <del>f</del>latcar</Step> <Step><span class="reverse">latcarf</span></Step> <Finally><label>TWO</label> f**ractal**</Finally></Example>.
