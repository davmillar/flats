## Terminal rotation

A pair of words becomes another pair of words when all four terminal letters shift position, in a manner analagous to rotating tires on a car: each front letter moves to the end, while the back letters move in front and switch words. Examples: <Example><Step>*t*en*d*, *b*um*s*</Step> <Finally>*s*en*t*, *d*um*b*</Finally></Example>; <Example><Step>*d*appe*r*, *s*ough*t*</Step> <Finally>*t*appe*d*, *r*ough*s*</Finally></Example>; <Example><Step>*t*ap*s*, *l*ai*r*</Step> <Finally>*r*ap*t*, *s*ai*l*</Finally></Example>.

The terminal rotation was invented by Bartok and introduced in August 1998.
