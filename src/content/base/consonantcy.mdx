## Consonantcy

Two or more words or phrases share the same consonants in the same order, with any number of vowels. Y is treated as a vowel. Example: <Example>acorn, crayon, ocarina</Example>.

> CONSONANTCY (5, 7, 7)
> 
> Each time I play a polka, all the girls pelt me with peonies.<br/>
> I start a samba—snowdrops, if you please!<br/>
> Before I’ve run a rumba through, it rains down rhododendrons,<br/>
> And when I ONE the TWO they throw me THREEs.

> =Trazom

The solution: ONE = begin, TWO = beguine, THREE = begonia.

The consonantcy was invented by Newrow in 1991.

In a **reversed consonantcy**, the consonants of the second word or phrase are reversed with respect to the consonants in the first word or phrase. Example: syzygy, gazes.

In a **consonantcy deletion**, consonants are deleted one by one from a starting word, and the basewords are consonantcies of the result. Examples: consonant, consent; amounting, untongue, Antigua. The consonantcy deletion was invented by Newrow.

A **consonantcy word deletion** works like a word deletion, except that only consonants are considered. That is, the inner word to be deleted is a consonantcy for some central section of the main base word; the remaining consonants are used in the outer word. Examples: quartz; rote, quiz and situation comedy, tonic, esteemed. It was invented by Newrow.

In a **consonantcy palindrome deletion**, delete a palindromic set of three or more consonants. Example: Matterhorn, mutation (delete rhr).
