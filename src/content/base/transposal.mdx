## Transposal

A word or phrase becomes another when its letters are rearranged. Examples: <Example>sleuth, hustle</Example>; <Example>Earl of Coventry <label>(a children’s card game)</label>, olfactory nerve</Example>. A transposal can have more than two parts, as in this example: <Example>blamed, beldam, ambled, bedlam, lambed</Example>.

Certain special types of transposals have their own names: the <span class="todo">[**head-to-tail shift**](base/head-to-tail-shift)</span> (the first letter becomes the last), the <span class="todo">[**letter shift**](base/letter-shift)</span> (one letter moves to a new place), the [**metathesis**](base/metathesis) (two letters exchange places), the <span class="todo">[**reversal**](base/reversal)</span> (the letter order is reversed), and the [**transpogram**](base/transpogram) (a word or phrase is divided into two pieces, which exchange places). These are described under their own titles.

When a transposal contains more than two parts, two of them might form a special kind of transposal without that being noted. For example, in one of the preceding examples beldam and bedlam form a metathesis, but this needn’t be mentioned with the puzzle.
