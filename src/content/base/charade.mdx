Only the enumeration of the longest word or phrase (WHOLE) is given. The solver has to figure out the lengths of the shorter parts. However, it is noted if any shorter part is capitalized, hyphenated, or a phrase.

### [Phonetic](modifier/phonetic) charade

<Step>red + rum</Step>
<Finally>murder</Finally>
