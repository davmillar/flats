## Cyclegram

Each word in the base consists of two parts. The first part is identical to the second part of the preceding word; the second part is identical to the first part of the following word. The chain wraps around: the second part of the last word is identical to the first part of the first word. For a three-word base, the pattern is AB, BC, CA. Examples: <Example>mi**ca**, ca**se**, se**mi**</Example> and <Example>ing**le**, le**groom**, groom**ing**</Example>.

The cyclegram was invented by Badir and introduced in October 2007.
