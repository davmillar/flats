## Anagram

A word or phrase is turned into an appropriate comment or description when its letters are rearranged. For example, <Example>THEY SEE</Example> is a good anagram of <Example>the eyes</Example>. One-word anagram bases are not enumerated; phrases are. If a dictionary entry-phrase forms all or part of the solution, its enumeration may be [bracketed] at the editor's option. Some more examples (asterisks indicate capitalized words):

<blockquote>
IS TEMPO, SIRS

=Ulk
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
BENEATH CHOPIN (3 5 5)

=Manx
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
GEE, TALKER, I'M LOST! (2'1 3 *5 2 2)

=Wabbit
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
SNUB I USE FOR NOSY ONE ("4 2 4 8")

=Famulus
</blockquote>

The solutions:<br/>
<Example><Step>IS TEMPO, SIRS</Step> <Finally>prestissimo</Finally></Example><br/>
<Example><Step>BENEATH CHOPIN</Step><Finally>the piano bench</Finally></Example><br/>
<Example><Step>GEE, TALKER, I'M LOST!</Step><Finally>it's all Greek to me</Finally></Example><br/>
<Example><Step>SNUB I USE FOR NOSY ONE</Step><Finally>"none of your business"</Finally></Example>

An anagram is usually given without any verse, the anagram itself providing the necessary clues.

An **antigram** is an anagram whose meaning is the opposite of the solution. For example, <Example>GREAT HUGE
BIRD (3 10) <cite>(=Wabbit)</cite></Example> is an antigram of <Example>the budgerigar</Example> (parakeet).

Anagrams have long been used for satirical and political comment. Sometimes, then, whether a particular puzzle should be called an anagram or an antigram is a matter of opinion. Sibyl termed this sort of puzzle an **ambigram**.
For example, <Example>YOUR RULES CLONE ATOMIC NIGHTMARES <cite>(=Te-Zir-Man)</cite></Example> is an ambigram of <Example>the Nuclear Regulatory Commission</Example>.

A **mutation** is a rearrangement of letters that is only vaguely appropriate or even entirely irrelevant to its solution. It is always accompanied by a verse that provides the clues. Mutations are not popular, but they still appear on occasion, usually with very good or very funny verses.

### Some Guidelines for Anagrams

Good anagrams need good bases (solutions). Anagrams frequently refer to a specific event, person, or object, often currently in the news. If the base is a phrase, it should be a dictionary entry-or a proverb, title, quotation, or other familiar phrase-never just a random group of words. <Example>Newspaper correspondents</Example>, for example, is a fine base. <Example caution>Correspondents of the newspapers</Example> is much less good: the phrase is seldom said that way. <Example bad>Our experienced hometown newspaper correspondents</Example> is unacceptable, since it drags in several irrelevant words. Avoid unnecessary words: <Example>Ivanhoe, by Sir Walter Scott</Example> is a good base (and in fact was once anagrammed as <Example>A NOVEL BY A SCOTTISH WRITER</Example>), while <Example bad>Ivanhoe, the beloved historical novel by Sir Walter Scott</Example> is not. Unless an anagram phrase is truly familiar or easily found (in the news, for instance), it is probably unfair to solvers.

Long anagrams burden the solver with too many possibilities to consider; the shortest base on a given topic generally makes the best anagram. If an anagram is very long-say, thirty letters or more-the solver is faced with so many thousands of possibilities that the anagram must be very apposite indeed if it's to be a fair challenge. (And with that many letters to work with, the composer ought to produce perfect apposition.)

A good anagram refers clearly and directly to its base. These examples are unacceptable: <Example bad><Step>DEATHSMEN BE</Step> <Finally>beheadments</Finally></Example> (only vaguely and indirectly related), and
<Example bad><Step>HI, POMPOUS PAT!</Step> <Finally>hippopotamus</Finally></Example> (wholly
irrelevant).

An anagram must match its base in tense, number, and person. More bad examples: <Example bad><Step>DOZES ON</Step> <Finally>snoozed</Finally></Example> (wrong tense), and <Example bad><Step>THAT QUEER SHAKE</Step> <Finally>the earthquakes</Finally></Example> (wrong number). Even if the part of speech differs, as in an adjective or adverb describing a noun base, it should be correctly inferable (as <Example><Step>BENEATH CHOPIN</Step> <Finally>the piano bench</Finally></Example>).

An anagram should not include any forms of the words in its base. <Example bad>EDITED REVISION</Example> is a singularly pointless anagram for &ldquo;revised edition&rdquo;. Even the repetition of a short word like &ldquo;by&rdquo; in the Ivanhoe anagram above is a flaw, as is the similarity of &ldquo;Scott&rdquo; and &ldquo;Scottish&rdquo;. The editor is the final judge of whether a flawed anagram is still fine enough to merit printing.

Every word not directly relevant to the solution is a flaw. Short "junk words" like O, la, and ha are particularly common, because they are easy ways for an anagrammer to use up a few leftover letters; but they are still flaws. Eliminate them if you can: <Example caution>O, CONES EVICT LAVA</Example> is a flawed anagram of <Example caution>active volcanoes</Example>; but changing the base slightly to <Example>the active volcanos</Example> allows <Example>CONES EVICT HOT LAVA</Example>.

The single most important thing to remember: the connection between the anagram and its base must be instantly clear when you see them together. It follows that the anagram is the most paradoxical of puzzles: the better it is, the easier it is!
