## Letter Shift

A word or phrase becomes another when one letter is shifted to a new position. For example: <Example><Step><label>ONE</label> <del>t</del>rollop</Step> <Finally><label>TWO</label> roll <ins>t</ins>op</Finally></Example>.

<blockquote>
LETTER SHIFT (*6, 6)

When ONE was just a little TWO,<br/>
In Illiers he lived and played.<br/>
Then, as those times began to fade,<br/>
He went in search of temps perdu.

=Belles Lettres
</blockquote>

The solution: <Example><Step><label>ONE</label> Proust</Step> <Finally><label>TWO</label> sprout</Finally></Example>.

If the letter is shifted only one space (as <Step>complaint</Step> <Finally>compliant</Finally>), the puzzle is traditionally classified as a <a href="/base/metathesis">**metathesis**</a> instead.

If the letter is shifted from the beginning to the end of the word, the puzzle is a special type of letter shift called a <a href="/base/head-to-tail-shift">**head-to-tail shift**</a>.

In a **reversed letter shift**, a word or phrase becomes another when one letter is shifted to a new position and the result is reversed. For example: <Example><Step><label>ONE</label> <del>i</del>gnited</Step> <Step>gnite<ins>i</ins>d</Step> <Finally><label>TWO</label> <span class="reverse">dieting</span></Finally></Example>.

In a **sound shift**, a word or phrase becomes another when one sound is shifted to a new position. For example: <Example><Step><label>ONE</label> <del>um</del>ber</Step> <Finally><label>TWO</label> b<ins>umm</ins>er</Finally></Example>.
