## Double-Cross

Two words or phrases are each divided into two pieces; then their second pieces are switched to form two others. Example: <Example><Step><label>ONE</label> ma**ids**, <label>TWO</label> rap**ture**</Step> <Finally><label>THREE</label> ma**ture**, <label>FOUR</label> rap**ids**</Finally></Example>. (This would appear in the
  solutions list as &ldquo;ma/ids, rap/ture.&rdquo;)

<blockquote>
    DOUBLE-CROSS (8, 5, 4, *9) (*9 = NI2)
        
    With a slim, steely ONE,<br/>
    The foul deed was done;<br/>
    The client was given the sack.<br/>
    From offstage, a noble<br/>
    Sang &ldquo;Woman is mobile.&rdquo;<br/>
    So-who could FOUR have on his back?
    
    A dread hunch had he<br/>
    When he felt the sack THREE:<br/>
    Of what burden was he the carrier?<br/>
    Gilda set up a din<br/>
    (TWO had not yet set in)<br/>
    And bade FOUR farewell with an aria.

The solution: <Example><Step><label>ONE</label> sti**letto**, <label>TWO</label> rigo**r**</Step> <Finally><label>THREE</label> sti**r**, <label>FOUR</label> Rigo**letto**</Finally></Example>. (This
would appear as &ldquo;sti/letto, rigo/r.&rdquo;)

The enumeration of all four parts of a double-cross is given.

When composing or solving a double-cross, be careful not to mix up THREE and FOUR: note that ONE and THREE have the same beginning, as do TWO and FOUR.

In a **<a href="modifier/phonetic">phonetic</a> double-cross**, the parts are rearranged phonetically and not by spelling. For example: <Example><Step><label>ONE</label> Hall of F**ame**, <label>TWO</label> g**urneys**</Step> <Finally><label>THREE</label> Holof**ernes**, <label>FOUR</label> g**ame**</Finally></Example>.

In a **reversed double-cross**, after switching the second pieces of ONE and TWO, you reverse the results to get THREE and FOUR. For example: <Example><Step><label>ONE</label> red ro**ver**, <label>TWO</label> Ere**bus**</Step> <Finally><label>THREE</label> **sub**order, <label>FOUR</label> **rev**ere</Finally></Example>. (This would appear as &ldquo;red ro/ver, Ere/bus.&rdquo;)

Based on an idea by Stilicho, the double-cross was introduced by Nightowl at the 1980 convention.
