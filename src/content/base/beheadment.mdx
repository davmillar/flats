## Beheadment

A word or phrase becomes another when its first letter is removed. Examples: <Example type="removal">~f~actor</Example>; or <Example type="removal">~u~sable</Example>. If the parts of the solution are all single words, the length of only the longest is given; if any part is a phrase, all parts are enumerated.

The solution: <Example><Step><label>WHOLE</label> ~u~sable</Step> <Finally><label>SHORTER</label> sable</Finally></Example>

Beheadments occasionally include more than two words. A famous example is <Example>aspirate, spirate, pirate, irate, rate, ate</Example>.

In a **bigram beheadment**, a word or phrase becomes another when its first two letters are removed: <Example>~de~livery</Example>.

In a **phonetic beheadment**, a word or phrase becomes another when its first sound is removed. All parts are enumerated. Example: <Example><Step>~b~asalt</Step> <Finally>assault</Finally></Example>. For discussion of what constitutes a single sound, see <a href="modifier/phonetic">phonetic flats</a>.

In a **reversed beheadment**, after beheading the first word, reverse it to get the second. Example: <Example><Step>~p~etal</Step> <Finally>late</Finally></Example>.
