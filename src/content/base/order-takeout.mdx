## Order takeout

From a longer word, every sequence of two or more adjacent letters in consecutive alphabetical order is removed to form a shorter word. Example: <Example><Step>~def~en~ders~</Step> <Finally>en</Finally></Example>.

In a **redro takeout**, sequences in reverse alphabetical order are removed. Examples: <Example><Step>deb~uted~</Step> <Finally>deb</Finally></Example>; <Example><Step>op~pon~en~ts~</Step> <Finally>open</Finally></Example>; and <Example><Step>~po~st~pon~ing</Step> <Finally>sting</Finally></Example>.
