## Change of heart

Two words or phrases are each divided into three pieces; then their middle pieces are switched to form two others. Example: <Example><Step><label>ONE</label> s~har~e, <label>TWO</label> c~ol~t</Step> <Finally><label>THREE</label> sole, <label>FOUR</label> chart</Finally></Example>. (This would appear in the solution list as “s(har)e, c(ol)t.) Another example: <Example><Step><label>ONE</label> win~e ste~ward, <label>TWO</label> F~D~R</Step> <Finally><label>THREE</label> windward, <label>FOUR</label> fester</Finally></Example> (“win(e ste)ward, F(D)R”).

A change of heart is similar to a [DOUBLE-CROSS](base/double-cross), except that the pieces that are switched come from the middles of the ONE and TWO rather than the ends. Note that as in a double-cross, ONE and THREE have the same beginnings, as do TWO and FOUR. (See also the [HEART TRANSPLANT](base/heart-transplant).)

The change of heart was invented by Lunch Boy and named by Xemu.
