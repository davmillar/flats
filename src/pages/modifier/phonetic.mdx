## Phonetic

Puzzle variations in which sounds are the basic unit instead of letters.

## Examples

### Phonetic [beheadment](base/beheadment)

<span class="before">quest</span>
<span class="before"><del>q</del>uest</span>
<span class="after">west</span>

### Phonetic [locksmith](base/locksmith)

<span class="before">lox + myth</span>
<span class="after">locksmith</span>

### Phonetic [curtailment](base/curtailment)

<span class="before">cute</span>
<span class="before">cu<del>t</del>e</span>
<span class="after">queue</span>
  
In a phonetic curtailment, TWO can be longer than ONE; what counts is the number of sounds, not the number of letters. In fact, the greater the change in spelling, the more interesting the base.

## When to Label

A flat is phonetic if any part is phonetic, even if some parts are not. For example, this phonetic charade:

<span class="before"><label>ONE</label> weigh + <label>TWO</label> ding</span>
<span class="after"><label>ALL</label> wading</span>

No flat is labeled phonetic if it can also work as a letter-based puzzle.

<span class="before">mite</span>
<span class="before"><del>m</del><ins>r</ins>ite</span>
<span class="after">rite</span>

'Mite' to 'rite' is both a first-[letter change](base/letter-change) and a first-sound change, but it is called a first-letter change.

<span class="before">mite</span>
<span class="before"><del>m</del><ins>r</ins>ite</span>
<span class="after">right</span>

'Mite' to 'right' has to be a first-sound change.

## Sound Identification

The underlined letters, as pronounced in the following words, stand for single sounds: l<u>ou</u>d, <u>ch</u>in, <u>wh</u>ale, <u>j</u>oke, si<u>ng</u>, c<u>oi</u>n, <u>sh</u>ip, <u>th</u>in, <u>th</u>is, vi<u>si</u>on. These sounds are indivisible. On the other hand, these represent two sounds: f<u>ew</u> and c<u>u</u>rable. The y and oo sounds are separate.

Modern pronunciation varies widely; you&rsquo;re likely to encounter phonetic flats that don&rsquo;t work in your speech. They are still legal and valid as long as MW substantiates their pronunciation. These pronunciation variations are common enough to be acceptable without comment in flats:

```
  <p>w = hw. For most Americans, <span class="w">where</span> and
  <span class="w">wear</span> are homonyms.</p>

  <p>For many Americans, T and D have the same sound between two
  vowels if the second vowel is unstressed; <span class=
  "w">latter</span> and <span class="w">ladder</span> are
  homonyms.</p>

  <p>&auml; = &#335;. For most Americans, <span class=
  "w">bother</span> rhymes with <span class="w">father</span>. For
  a minority, <span class="w">cot</span> is a homonym of
  <span class="w">caught</span>.</p>

  <p>Before a vowel sound, ar = er = &#257;r. Many Americans
  pronounce <span class="w">Mary</span> and <span class=
  "w">merry</span> the same, and a large minority pronounce
  <span class="w">marry</span> the same as the other two. 11C is
  not consistent on this point; NI3 explains it. Phonetic flats
  based on this pronunciation are not tagged &ldquo;NI3
  pronunciation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>r = schwa or nothing. For many r-droppers, <span class=
  "w">card</span> and <span class="w">cod</span> are homonyms, as
  are <span class="w">manners</span> and <span class=
  "w">mannas</span>.</p>

  <p>schwa = short i, most often unstressed. For many, <span class=
  "w">language</span> and <span class="w">languid</span> are a
  last-sound change.</p>
