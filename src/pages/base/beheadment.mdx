## Beheadment

A word or phrase becomes another when its first letter is removed.

<span class="before">factor</span> <span class="before"><del>f</del>actor</span> <span class="after">actor</span>

If the parts of the solution are all single words, the length of only the longest is given; if any part is a phrase, all parts are enumerated.

> BEHEADMENT (6)
> 
> I wonder if this SHORTER stole,<br/>
> Though slightly tattered, still is WHOLE.
>
> =Wabbit

<span class="before"><label>WHOLE</label> usable</span> <span class="before"><del>u</del>sable</span> <span class="after"><label>SHORTER</label> sable</span>

Beheadments occasionally include more than two words.

<p class="example-block">
<span class="before">aspirate</span> <span class="before"><del>a</del>spirate</span><br/>
<span class="before">spirate</span> <span class="before"><del>s</del>pirate</span><br/>
<span class="before">pirate</span> <span class="before"><del>p</del>irate</span><br/>
<span class="before">irate</span> <span class="before"><del>i</del>rate</span><br/>
<span class="before">rate</span> <span class="before"><del>r</del>ate</span>
<span class="after">ate</span>
</p>

<span class="before">delivery</span> <span class="before"><del>de</del>livery</span> <span class="after">livery</span>

### Phonetic beheadment

a word or
phrase becomes another when its first sound is removed. All parts
are enumerated.

<span class="before">basalt</span> <span class="before"><del>b</del>asalt</span> <span class="after">assault</span>

For discussion of what constitutes a single sound, see <a href="modifier/phonetic">phonetic flats</a>.

### Reversed beheadment

After beheading the first word, reverse it to get the second.
