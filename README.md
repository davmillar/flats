# Flats

## Project Description

This is meant to be a tool for helping puzzlers understand, solve, and/or write the various types of NPL flat puzzles.

## Project Plan

1. Reproduce the Guide to the Enigma as of May 2023 and stand it up as an Astro site.
2. Provide a modern, mobile-friendly layout.
3. Provide search capabilities and metadata to distinguish things like base flat types, modifiers, and variants.
4. Update with new flat types missing from the guide.
5. Amend with new examples and visual diagrams where useful.
